    # Roulette selection attempts to balance genetic diversity and fitness based on
    # probability. Individuals that are more fit have a higher chance of getting
    # selected; however, itâ€™s still possible that individuals that are less fit will get
    # selected as well. Think of it like this: in Wheel of Fortune, the more valuable
    # spaces have a smaller area, meaning the probability of landing on them is
    # lower. The relationship is the same in roulette selection, albeit in reverse.
    #
    # Roulette selection is by far the slowest and most difficult algorithm to implement;
    # however, it does a great job of maintaining the fitness of a population
    # while including some diverse parents.
